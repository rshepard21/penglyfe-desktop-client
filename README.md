## üöÄ Usage
### For Users or Testers
Just go to the [releases page](https://github.com/frostygg/desktop/releases) and download the exe. dmg, or AppImage for the latest release (depending if you're on Windows, Mac, or Linux).
Windows builds only support x64 systems.

If you're testing, you might want a build of the latest commit. AppVeyor automatically builds each commit, and you can get those builds [here](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/daniel11420/backdesktop/build/artifacts).

### For Developers
You need [node.js](https://nodejs.org). The latest version is recommended but others work too.

Installation:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/frostygg/desktop
cd desktop
npm i
npm start
```
Building:
```sh
npm run make-win
npm run make-mac
npm run make-linux
```
